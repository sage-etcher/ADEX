ADE Advanatge Emulator README FILE


Quick Start:

Untar the distribution file and cd to the top directory.

If you have the normal Linux development packages installed, that's great.

If you have the GTK+ development package installed, that's even better.

In that case, issue the command

       meson setup build
       ninja -C build


If all compiles properly, isuue the commands

       meson install -C build
       mkdir ~/advantage
       cp -R /usr/local/share/ade/disks ~/advantage/
       cp /usr/local/share/doc/ade/examples/ade.conf.example ~/advantage/ade.conf
       sed -i  "s,/usr/local/share/ade,$HOME/advantage," ~/advantage/ade.conf
and
       ade


Otherwise:

head to <https://github.com/sage-etcher/ADE-Documentation.git>, 
cd to the 'documentation' and read Section 2 of the 'North Star Advantage (ADE) User's Guide'.

Better still, read the whole guide first.

Enjoy.
