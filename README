This fork is abandoned. I have opted to write my own codebase over adapting this one.

I would please direct you to NSAE <https://github.com/sage-etcher/nsae> for my take on emulating the system.


ADE Advanatge Emulator README FILE


Quick Start:

Untar the distribution file and cd to the top directory.

If you have the normal Linux development packages installed, that's great.

If you have the GTK+ development package installed, that's even better.

In that case, issue the command

       make

If all compiles properly, isuue the commands


       make install
 and
       ade


Otherwise:

cd to the 'documentation' and read Section 2 of the 'North Star Advantage (ADE) User's Guide'.

Better still, read the whole guide first.

Enjoy.
